# image2puzzle - Project Context for Claude

## Project Overview
An interactive puzzle game built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML5 Canvas, and Vite. Users can upload any image and solve it as a puzzle with realistic interlocking jigsaw pieces featuring authentic "shoulders and head" bezier curve designs with multiple pattern variations.

**Status**: 🚧 In Development - Core functionality working but several issues need resolution before production deployment.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript (ES6 modules)
- **Canvas**: HTML5 Canvas API for rendering
- **Build Tool**: Vite 7.1.7
- **Deployment**: Netlify (configured)
- **Package Manager**: npm
- **License**: MIT

## Core Architecture

### main.js (PuzzleApp)
- **Purpose**: UI controller and application orchestrator
- **Responsibilities**:
  - DOM element initialization and event binding
  - File upload handling (image selection)
  - UI controls (difficulty, shuffle, reference, pan, fullscreen)
  - Timer management (start, stop, display)
  - Progress tracking and victory detection
  - Modal management (reference image, victory screen)
  - Keyboard shortcuts (Space: pan, F: fullscreen, R: reference)
  - Touch event handling for mobile/tablet support
  - Canvas interaction delegation to PuzzleGame

### puzzle.js (PuzzleGame)
- **Purpose**: Core game engine and state management
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Canvas management and resizing
  - Image loading from file
  - Puzzle initialization with configurable grid size
  - Piece creation and management
  - Shuffle algorithm (randomize positions outside puzzle area)
  - Drag & drop mechanics (mouse/touch events)
  - Pan & zoom functionality (navigation for large puzzles)
  - Snap detection and validation logic
  - Neighbor-based connection rules (first piece OR edge piece OR has placed neighbor)
  - Completion detection
  - Rendering pipeline with proper z-ordering
  - Visual feedback (puzzle boundary guide with dotted rectangle and corner markers)

### pieces.js (PuzzlePiece)
- **Purpose**: Individual puzzle piece representation and rendering
- **Responsibilities**:
  - Jigsaw piece shape generation with realistic "shoulders and head" bezier curves (6 curves per edge)
  - Four distinct tab/blank pattern variations for natural diversity
  - Tab/blank configuration (interlocking design)
  - Offscreen canvas pre-rendering for performance with separate X/Y scale factors
  - Path2D caching for collision detection
  - Position management (current vs correct position)
  - Snap logic (threshold-based positioning)
  - Neighbor detection (top, right, bottom, left)
  - Edge piece identification
  - Visual states (dragging, placed, near-position highlighting)
  - Image clipping to piece shape with proper aspect ratio handling
  - Shadow effects and outline rendering
  - Image rendering (⚠️ ISSUE: Not covering full piece area - gaps in tabs/blanks)

## Key Features

### Gameplay
1. **Image Upload**: FileReader API for local image loading
2. **Difficulty Levels**: 
   - Easy (3×3 = 9 pieces)
   - Medium (4×4 = 16 pieces)
   - Hard (5×5 = 25 pieces)
   - Expert (6×6 = 36 pieces)
3. **Realistic Pieces**: Algorithmically generated tabs and blanks using bezier curves
4. **Smart Snapping**:
   - 50px threshold for snap detection (⚠️ ISSUE: Too large, needs reduction)
   - Must be first piece OR edge piece OR have a placed neighbor
   - Visual feedback (green = can snap, red = cannot snap without neighbor)
   - ⚠️ ISSUE: Green highlight reveals correct position when hovering, spoiling the puzzle
5. **Timer**: Real-time tracking with MM:SS format
6. **Progress**: Percentage-based completion indicator

### Controls
- **Mouse Drag**: Click and drag pieces
- **Touch**: Full touch support for tablets/mobile
- **Pan Mode**: Hold Space or click pan button to navigate
- **Zoom**: Mouse wheel to zoom in/out (0.5x to 3x scale)
- **Reference**: View original image in modal
- **Fullscreen**: Immersive puzzle-solving mode

### Visual Design
- **Dotted Puzzle Boundary**: Guide for correct placement area
- **Corner Markers**: Enhanced visibility of puzzle boundaries
- **Green Outline**: Correctly placed pieces
- **Drag Shadow**: Visual depth during piece movement
- **Snap Preview**: Green/red highlight based on connection rules (⚠️ ISSUE: Reveals correct position)

## Technical Details

### Performance Optimizations
1. **Offscreen Canvas**: Each piece pre-rendered to separate canvas
2. **Path2D Caching**: Shape paths cached for reuse
3. **Efficient Rendering**: Only redraws on user interaction
4. **Z-Index Management**: Proper layering without full re-sorts
5. **Minimal Dependencies**: Fast load times, no frameworks

### Puzzle Piece Algorithm
- Pieces are generated with random tab/blank configuration
- Tab direction is coordinated between neighboring pieces (one tab = opposite blank)
- Edge pieces have null tabs (straight edges)
- Tab size is 20% of piece dimensions
- **Realistic "Shoulders and Head" Design**:
  - Each tab/blank edge uses 6 bezier curves (not simple arcs)
  - Creates authentic jigsaw piece shape with shoulders, neck, and head structure
  - Control points carefully designed for professional puzzle appearance
- **Four Pattern Variations**:
  - Pattern 1: Classic shoulders and head (balanced proportions)
  - Pattern 2: Wider base with broader shoulders
  - Pattern 3: Narrow neck with more pronounced head
  - Pattern 4: Rounded with smoother curves
  - Each piece side randomly selects one of 4 patterns for natural diversity
- **Guaranteed Special Piece**:
  - At least one interior piece guaranteed to have all 4 sides as inward blanks (quadruple blank piece)
  - Creates a unique "carved out" piece surrounded by tabs
  - Adds variety and visual interest to the puzzle
- **Image Rendering** (⚠️ IN PROGRESS):
  - Tab regions designed to expand into neighboring piece image areas
  - Separate X/Y scale factors for aspect ratio preservation
  - ⚠️ ISSUE: Currently not rendering complete image across piece - gaps visible in tabs/blanks

### Snap Logic Rules
A piece can snap to its correct position when:
1. It's within 50px of correct position (⚠️ ISSUE: This threshold is too large - needs reduction) AND
2. One of these conditions:
   - It's the first piece being placed (placedCount === 0)
   - It's an edge piece (row/col === 0 or gridSize-1)
   - It has at least one neighbor already placed

This prevents "floating" pieces in the middle of the puzzle.

## Build & Deployment

### Development
```bash
npm install       # Install dependencies
npm run dev       # Start dev server (http://localhost:5173)
```

### Production
```bash
npm run build     # Build to dist/
npm run preview   # Preview production build
```

### Netlify Deployment
- **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- **Publish Directory**: `dist`
- **Redirects**: SPA redirect configured in netlify.toml
- **Status**: ⚠️ Configured but NOT YET DEPLOYED

## Browser Compatibility
- Chrome/Edge (recommended) - full support
- Firefox - full support
- Safari - full support
- Requires Canvas API support

## Current Development State

### Working Features
- All difficulty levels working (3×3 to 6×6)
- Realistic jigsaw pieces with "shoulders and head" bezier curve design
- Four pattern variations creating natural puzzle piece diversity
- Guaranteed quadruple inward blank piece for unique challenge
- Snap logic with neighbor validation implemented
- Pan/zoom navigation working smoothly
- Timer and progress tracking active
- Victory detection and modal display
- Touch support enabled for tablets/mobile
- Keyboard shortcuts functional (Space, F, R)
- Clean white text styling throughout UI

### Known Issues (Pre-Production)
1. **Image Rendering Incomplete**: Images not rendering across the entire puzzle piece - gaps or missing areas visible in tabs/blanks
2. **Collision Assistant Too Revealing**: Green highlight appears when hovering near correct position, giving away the solution
3. **Snap Distance Too Large**: 50px snap threshold is too generous - pieces snap together when too far apart, making puzzle too easy
4. **Not Deployed**: Netlify configuration exists but site not yet published

## Known Behavior
- First piece can be placed anywhere (no neighbor requirement)
- Edge pieces can always be placed (they form the frame)
- Interior pieces require at least one placed neighbor
- This creates a natural progression: build edges first, then fill interior

## Development Notes
- No external dependencies beyond Vite for bundling
- Pure ES6 modules, no transpilation needed for modern browsers
- Canvas rendering is hardware-accelerated
- Image dimensions automatically scaled to fit canvas (80% of viewport)
- Aspect ratio preserved during puzzle creation
